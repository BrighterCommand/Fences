# Fences Incident Response Checklist

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

This document is a checklist to help you through the _Incident Response Process_ (IRP) for a security
vulnerability reported in Fences. It is designed to help you triage, mitigate, scope, disclose, and
learn from the report, as appropriate.

This template should be copied into a privately created [security advisory][advisories] and used to
track the response.

---

## 🏷️ Phase 1️⃣ Triage

> [!TIP]
> Before starting the IRP, take a moment to reflect on the report and the vulnerability.
> Maybe grab a cup of coffee or tea.
>
> It is better to consider the report rather than start a knee-jerk reaction in panic.

### 📢 Updates

> [!TIP]
> Use this section to detail the report received, and include any reproduction results, mitigating
> factors and the impact of the issue.

For example:

> I've read the report and validated this vulnerability does exist.
>
> The exploit is difficult to achieve due to the following:
>
> - It require precise timing and multiple steps to achieve.
> - It requires a specific set of configurations and advanced knowledge.
>
> The impact of the exploit:
>
> - Causes an infinite loop in a resilience strategy.
> - Exhausts the CPU of the application.

### 🧑‍🏫 Guidance

> [!TIP]
> Use this section to link to any reference documentation from triaging the vulnerability, if any.

### ✅ Tasks

> [!TIP]
> Tasks that should be completed before moving on to mitigation if any vulnerabilities are confirmed.

- [ ] Review the report and reproduce the vulnerability
- [ ] Request additional information from the reporter if needed
- [ ] If not provided, request a minimal proof of concept (PoC) and/or exploit, if needed
- [ ] Understand the vulnerability/situation
- [ ] Update the vulnerability with the current understanding
- [ ] Determine the severity
- [ ] Determine which Fences packages are affected (`Paramore.Fences`, `Paramore.Fences.Core`, etc.)
- [ ] Determine which Fences versions are affected (e.g. 9.0.0)
- [ ] Determine whether any prominent dependent projects are affected (e.g. [Brighter][brighter], etc.)
- [ ] Determine whether the vulnerability is **inherited from [Polly][polly]**, i.e. it exists in the
      code as it stood before the fork
  - [ ] If yes, [Polly][polly] and everything downstream of it (including [ASP.NET Core][aspnetcore]
        via `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience`) is likely affected too
  - [ ] If yes, report it privately to the Polly maintainers through
        [their advisories page][polly-advisories] and plan to coordinate disclosure
- [ ] Determine which platforms and/or operating systems are affected, if relevant
- [ ] Determine the pull request/commit where the vulnerability was first introduced
- [ ] Has the vulnerability been caused by, or caused, any of our secrets to be leaked?
- [ ] Coordinate with the other maintainers if needed — use the advisory itself, or direct messages on GitHub, not a public channel
- [ ] Decide if the reported vulnerability is valid
  - [ ] Close if non-actionable or not within scope
  - [ ] Proceed to mitigation if actionable/confirmed

### 🗒️ For the record

> [!TIP]
> What did you determine during this phase?

- Is there a direct risk of [CIA][cia] being broken? `Yes|No`
- Which part of [CIA][cia] could be broken? `Confidentiality|Integrity|Availability`
- What user data is at risk, if any?
- What is required to exploit this vulnerability?
- Are there any mitigating factors and/or workarounds that reduce the risk of exploitation?
- The vulnerability was introduced on: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Is there a pull request where the vulnerability was introduced? `<URL>`
- Provide deep links(s) to the relevant lines of code, if applicable: `<URL>`
- Do we need to notify any dependent projects? `Yes|No`
  - If yes, which projects? `<URL>`

---

## 🏷️ Phase 2️⃣ Mitigation

### 📢 Updates

> [!TIP]
> Use this section to call out any blockers, challenges, or successes. This section may contain a mitigation plan or strategy to execute.

For example:

> To prevent potential exploitation, we've disabled the feature where this vulnerability exists.
>
> OR
>
> We identified the root cause, and are now working on a pull request to fully mitigate it.

Once a mitigation plan is in place, work will start to prepare any fixes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any fix preparation should be performed in a private fork of the repository linked to the security advisory.
> Only this private fork should be used to prepare the fix to avoid premature disclosure. As private forks do
> not have the capability to run GitHub Actions workflows, we cannot build and release any fixes in advance of
> disclosure. Instead, the fix should be submitted, merged and released as part of the disclosure process.
>
> This creates an unavoidable delay between the fix being merged and it being available to users, so technically
> the vulnerability will be a zero-day for a short period between the pull request being opened and the fixed
> version of any NuGet packages being published and indexed by NuGet.org.
>
> See here for information about creating a private fork: [_Collaborating in a temporary private fork to resolve a repository security vulnerability_][private-fork]

### ✅ Tasks

> [!TIP]
> Tasks that should be completed before moving on to scoping once the mitigation has been prepared.

- [ ] Re-assess severity and update if necessary
- [ ] Confirm libraries and versions that are affected by the vulnerability
- [ ] Confirm mitigation preparation across any identified packages
- [ ] Have any tests been added to ensure the vulnerability is mitigated?
- [ ] Is the proposed fix tactical (_"stop the bleeding"_) or comprehensive (_"addresses the root cause"_)?
  - [ ] If tactical, is it sufficient to mitigate the vulnerability?
- [ ] If any secrets (GitHub or NuGet token, Azure federated credentials) were leaked, have they been rotated?

### 🗒️ For the record

> [!TIP]
> What did you learn during this phase?

- The vulnerability was first mitigated on: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- The vulnerability affected: `Paramore.Fences|Paramore.Fences.Core|etc`
- Is there a link to the mitigation work? `<URL>`

## 🏷️ Phase 3️⃣ Scoping

### 📢 Updates

> [!TIP]
> Use this section to analyse the scope and impact of the vulnerability.

For example:

> We have run an analysis and identified this vulnerability affects every published version
> of `Paramore.Fences.Core`, and is reachable from the default retry configuration.

### ✅ Tasks

> [!TIP]
> Tasks that should be completed before moving on to disclosure.

Scoping is the process of interrogating data to determine if a vulnerability was used and/or exploited, and what the impact was. Some useful prompts are:

> - What is the goal of the scoping work? Writing down specific goals can help reframe the work that needs done.
> - How can you identify expected vs exploitative use?
> - Are you able to find known use of the vulnerability in the data?

- [ ] Review available information sources
- [ ] Confirm who was affected or might have been affected
- [ ] Do we need to coordinate with any dependent projects?
  - [ ] If yes, which projects? `<URL>`
  - [ ] If the vulnerability is inherited from Polly, are the Polly maintainers ready to disclose
        in step with us?
    - [ ] If [ASP.NET Core][aspnetcore] is affected through Polly, should [MSRC][msrc] be contacted?
      - [ ] If yes, contact MSRC and provide details of the vulnerability and await their response
- [ ] Does the mitigation need to be backported to previous versions?
  - [ ] If yes, which versions? `<URL>`
    - [ ] If yes, prepare a branch for each version
- [ ] Is the fix fully prepared, tested and ready for release?

### 📓 Notes

> Add your scoping notes here

### 🗒️ For the record

- [ ] Create a pull request to merge the fix into the public Fences repository for any relevant branches
  - [ ] The pull request should be minimally descriptive (i.e. what was changed, not why)
- [ ] Once all pull request(s) are merged, run the [release workflow][release-workflow] to prepare
      the draft GitHub release(s) for the fixed version(s).
  - [ ] The release information should be minimally descriptive (i.e. what was changed, not why)
- [ ] Once everything is ready, publish the GitHub releases, which will start the build/publish process to NuGet.org
